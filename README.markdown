GTDzen
------

This is a simple but flexible library and application to realize [Getting Things Done][gtd] method by David Allen.

GTDzen is based on a simplicity, so you'll not find any projects, contexts or areas of responsibility. I'm sure,
that all you need is smart tagging and correct priorities.

Interfaces
==========

There is only command line interface right now. But I'll be happy if somebody helps me to build a GUI for Mac OS X.

TODO
====

* setup.py script.
* help for command line interface.
* automatic database migrations.
* import/export to/from some XML format.
